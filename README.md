# NEXTshare
A full stack file sharing system, focusing on decentralization and security, leveraging next generation
Internet protocols and security mechanisms to provide ad-hoc content discovery and sharing using minimum
configuration.

## About
The goal of this project is to provide open-source software that can be used for decentralized file
sharing. The project will initially target Raspberry Pis connected using ad-hoc networking. This setup
emulates many emerging use cases, such as community networks, VANETs, (Aerial) MANETs.
